<dd>

This map layer consists of federally owned or administered lands of the United States, Puerto Rico,
and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  For the most part, only areas of 320 acres or more are included; some
smaller areas deemed to be important or significant are also included.  There may be private
inholdings within the boundaries of Federal lands in this map layer.  Some established Federal
lands which are larger than 320 acres are not included in this map layer, because their boundaries
were not available from the owning or administering agency.

features under this size are not shown.  There may be private inholdings within the boundaries of
Federal lands in this map layer.  Some established Federal lands which are larger than the minimum
